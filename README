            password => 'secret',
            server   => 'http://foo.com'
        );
        my $graph = Net::GraphSpace::Graph->new(name => 'yeast ppi');
        my $node1 = Net::GraphSpace::Node->new(id => 1, label => 'A');
        my $node2 = Net::GraphSpace::Node->new(id => 2, label => 'B');
        my $edge = Net::GraphSpace::Edge->new(
            id => '1-2', source => 1, target => 2);
        $graph->add_nodes([$node1, $node2]);
        $graph->add_edge($edge);
        $graph->add_node(Net::GraphSpace::Node->new(id => 3, label => 'C'));

        # Upload graph to server
        my $data = $client->add_graph($graph);
        my $graph_id = $data->{id};
        my $url = $data->{url};
        print "Your graph (id: $graph_id) can be viewed at $url\n";

        # Get and update a graph
        $graph = $clent->get_graph($graph_id);
        $graph->tags(['foo', 'bar']);
        $client->update_graph($graph_id, $graph);
